1. Overall process you went through, any key decisions made.

Read the instructions

I'm mostly comfortable with React, so I used create-react-app to get some boilerplate going on the front. Used express-generator for backend boilerplate.

Considered how I'd identify users (do I need a login on this?). Decided I should.

Login took a ton of time and I have a bug I can't fix where my session keeps resetting. I worked around it by just storing the la=st user in memory (this is a huge hack).

I wrote some Redux + thunk code to execute various actions a user would want.

I wrote backend REST APIs to handle those actions.

I wrote some React to actually do the actions and display results.



2. Shortcuts, simplifying assumptions, known bugs, etc.

- Given this project has a life of 6 hours and my coding style doesn't usually use TDD, I skipped tests.

- I didn't shop around to various financial APIs - your Yahoo API mention took me to yahoo-finance on NPM and then to google-finance so I used that package. THen I realized it was historical data, so I tried AlphaVantage.

- the client/server directory interaction is messy. Would love to add time cleaning this up.

- no TLS, session cookie is not secure

- caching is whatever the boilerplate gave me and no more.

- Redux actions are super coarse - would make them granular with more time (could reduce REST API response weight if I did)

- file structure is based on types of code, rather than topic/feature, which won't scale well.

- only tested in Chrome - I might need to polyfill some things like fetch for better support.

- avoided any kind of complex trades like LIMIT

- CORS is wildcarded and there's no content security policy stuff. I'd need to clean this up to restrict the API to only the website domain(s).

- I did literally zero CSS. Happy to come back to that later if you want to see it.

- AlphaVantage is incredibly slow. I'd cache this in a production app.



3. What slowed you down, what was unexpected

I haven't used create-react-app before and not used express in a very long time. Was just kinda winging it.






4. Any problems you ran into, and how you solved them

cookie + session pain. I still don't know why the session resets on every load, it's probably something trivial.

kids came back halfway through and I've had to help out with them. I'm out of time now (spent ~6 hours so far).
